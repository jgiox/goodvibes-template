# goodvibes in Replit Agent

**What you get:** the goodvibes rules (plan first, keep changes small, run the tests, record decisions in `JOURNAL.md`, ask before risky steps), for every Replit Agent task in this project. If the project is also on GitHub, the GitHub checks run on it as for any other tool.

**What you do not get:** the Claude Code guard rails (the journal check, the read guard, the session-start check and the permissions), the Claude Code skills such as caveman, `goodvibes usage`, and the Claude Code slash commands. goodvibes sets up context7 and headroom for Claude Code only, and does not install anything inside Replit. See [Getting started](../getting-started.md) for what each piece does.

## Setup

`goodvibes init` wrote `replit.md` into your project. Replit Agent reads it from the project root.

1. Get the goodvibes files into your Replit project, for example by pushing this folder to GitHub (see [Git and GitHub basics](../onboarding.md)) and importing it into Replit.
2. Check that `replit.md` is at the top level of the project, next to `JOURNAL.md`.
3. Commit `replit.md` to git. Replit Agent may rewrite this file, and a commit lets you get your version back.

If your Replit project does not have the goodvibes files, create `replit.md` at the top level of the project and paste in the contents of `replit.md` from the folder where you ran `goodvibes init`.

## Check that the rules are on

Ask Replit Agent: "Which rules do you follow in this project?" The answer should mention the goodvibes engineering rules, for example reading `JOURNAL.md` before acting.

## Turn it off

Delete `replit.md`, or remove the goodvibes rules from it.
